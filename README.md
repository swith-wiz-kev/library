Library

In this project, forms are used again. The forms are used as input to put book objects in an array. The array is manipulated with "Add Book" and "Remove Book" functionality, and the corresponding DOM elements are created and updated to the values of the library array. Data attributes are used to associate an HTML element to array so that the correct elements will be modified as the array is modified and vice versa.
